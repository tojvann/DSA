### Lecture 1

## Cover well-known data structures such as:

- Dynamic Arrays
- Linked List
- Stacks
- Queues
- Tree
- Graphs



_All the Data Structures are implemented in C++_



### Need for Data Structures

- Data structures organize data, this leads to more efficient programs. By efficiency i mean efficient in terms of both time and space.
- More powerful computer => More complex applications => Demand more calculations





> The choice of a data-structure and algorithm can make the difference between a program running in  a few seconds or many days.



## Efficiency

- A solution is said to be efficient if it solves the problem within its resource constraints.
  - Space
  - Time
- The cost of a solution is the amount of resources that solution consumes.



## Selecting a Data-Structure

1. Analyze the problem to determine the resource constraints a solution must meet.
2. Determine the basic operation that must be supported. Quantify the resource constraints for each operation.
3. Select the data structure that best meets these requirements



## Some questions to ask

- Are all the data inserted into the data structure at the beginning, or are insertions interspersed with other operations ?
- Can data be deleted ?
- Are all data processed is some well-defined order, or is random access allowed ?
